## Description

(in conjunction with use cases "Micro-frontends for manual scholarly annotation" and "Store, share and search web annotations")

For a researcher to be able to annotate details of online collection objects she has to be able to 'point' at such details in a persistent way. This requires for example that it is possible to identify regions in images, regions and time intervals in online digital video data and segments of text in textual resources, irrespective of the formats that are used to store these objects.

In the domain of online image data IIIF turned out to be very successful and has become a standard. Images are not published directly, but via an intermediate 'Canvas' that acts as a coordinate system that can be used for annotation by anybody.

In the AV domain there is work on extending this IIIF standard. CLARIAH partners are already involved in this.

The domain of text is the least explored domain, but also there, initiatives to publish 'text coordinate systems' exist, among which is ongoing work in the CLARIAH context:

- the work of Dirk Roorda (DANS) on TextFabric
- work on data generated in the Republic project and on TEI data at HuC

We propose to select three collections of CLARIAH partners, each of a different media type: image, AV and text, and make them easily accessible for manual annotation by publishing the proper coordinate systems.

### What is the research about?

Enable manual annotation scenarios over multiple collections of different media types by publishing the appropriate coordinate systems.

### What problem is hindering the research?

The need for online manual annotation infrastructure is often raised, in CLARIAH Plus and wider contexts. Still, manual annotation is not yet widely used. Probably the following three reasons play a role:

1. it is not easy enough to generate standard web annotations during scholarly workflows and handle them using standard web protocols.
2. once created, there is no easily accessible and community supported place to store those annotations
3. online collections can not be easily annotated, because they typically do not explicitly and persistently publish the (URIs of the) elements that can be annotated.

We defined use cases to tackle all three of these problems. 

For 1, use case "Micro-frontends for manual scholarly annotations"
For 2, use case "Store, share and search web annotations"
For 3, use case "Annotatable collections"

### What is needed to do the research?

Collection providers that are interested and committed to participate. HuC is one such partner, for text plus images. KB already expressed interest in such an experiment. A potential benefit for them is that it is much easier for them to benefit from enrichments of their published collections when these enrichments directly refer to KB versions of the data. For AV, it would be great if B&G can be interested.
