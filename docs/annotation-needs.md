## Annotation Needs {#annotation-needs}

### Scholarly Needs {#scholarly-needs}

CLARIAH research on need for scholarly annotation support:

* **Need for semantic targeting**: Scholars annotate resources using a browser. Browser-based annotation tools should not target the selected HTML for annotation, but the identifier(s) of the presented resource  (Boot et al. 2017, Koolen & Boot in press). In the case of Scholarly Digital Editions, there is a need for annotation clients to be able to reason over the different components of an edition and use context to determine which annotations to retrieve and show (Boot & Koolen 2018).
* **Need for nested targeting**: scholars annotate resources or parts of resources, which belong to collections and sub-collections. In many cases there is a hierarchical structure. When trying to find back annotations, scholars use the resources and collections they were annotating as contextual clues to search for annotations. So annotations should capture this larger context. If a scholar is annotating items on multiple television broadcasts of the evening news, their memory is of annotating the evening news as a regular TV program, not necessarily of the broadcast dates of the specific editions that they annotated. Being able to search for and retrieve annotations made on any edition of the evening news is a scholarly need that requires hierarchical information to be captured in annotations (Boot et al. 2017, Koolen & Boot, in press). 
* **Need for sharing and permissions**: scholars want to be able to have private annotations, but also to share them in a project group or make public so they can be cited (Koolen & Boot in press).
* **Need for searching and querying**: scholars want to bring together annotations related to a single research project, regardless of whether they were made on different (types of) resources. Querying for annotations that belong to the same project, or have specific annotation types of bodies (e.g. comments, transcriptions, codes, links), types of motivations (corrections, tags, comments) or different types of targets (newspaper articles, TV programs, correspondences, government resolutions, …). See Melgar-Estrada et al. (2017), Koolen et al. (2020).

### Use cases {#use-cases}

CLARIAH research on use cases:

* Koolen et al. (2020): Use cases where scholars bring together information from various sources in different contexts, using different applications, e.g. copying and pasting from PDF viewers, web pages, etc. into excel sheets. Interoperable annotation support could greatly reduce the required effort.
* Melgar-Estrada et al. (2017). Use cases in audio-visual annotation needs of media scholars.

Specific use cases:

* REPUBLIC end-user annotations (using Docere?)
* WP6 text annotations (using Inception)

## Annotation Support {#annotation-support}

See the [inventory in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Annotation/blob/master/inventory.md).

## Manual vs. Automatic Annotations {#manual-vs-automatic-annotations}

Considerations:

* WA format has huge overhead, fine for manual annotations, which won’t scale to the same extent as automatic annotations.
* Automatic annotations can be generated in vast quantities. Given the huge overhead in WA format, storing automatic annotations should preferably be in proprietary formats. Only for exchange of subsets of automatic annotations to viewing applications should WA be considered.
