# UDPipe Frysk: a tool for tokenising, lemmatising, tagging and dependency parsing annotation of Frisian text

**ID**: FRYPOS

**Author:** Hans Van de Velde, Gosse Bouma, Wilbert Heeringa

**Introduction:**

West Lauwers Frisian, a language having about 354,000 native speakers in the province of Friesland in the Northwest of the Netherlands. While a wealth of tools has been developed for large (inter)national languages like English, Spanish and French, this is not obviously the case for smaller regional minority languages. Until recently a tool for tokenising, lemmatising, tagging and dependency parsing annotation of Frisian was not available.

**What exists:**

Currently a tool is available that can be used for tokenising, lemmatising and tagging Frisian texts, but morphological and syntactical annotations cannot be generated yet. Besides, the tool is trained on the basis of a corpus that consists of only 51.710 tokens, 45,945 words and 3,250 sentences.

**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:**

We develop a tool for tokenising, lemmatising, tagging and dependency parsing annotation of Frisian text. We will follow the Universal Dependency guidelines (UD version 2) that are found at: https://universaldependencies.org/guidelines.html. 

We will extend the current treebank to 100,000 words. To this end, we will use texts that were used for the 'Oersetter', the online Frisian-Dutch translation program. We will also include material from the Online Nederlânsk-Frysk Wurdboek (ONFW). We aim to build a balanced corpus that should at least include the following genres: magazines, newspapers, Wikipedia, scientific texts.

The newly added texts will be tokenized and PoS-tagged with the tool as it is available at this moment. The PoS-tags will be manually corrected. Next, the Frisian texts will be translated literally to Dutch. On the basis of the Dutch translations the morphological and syntactical annotations are generated by using the Alpino parser which is using the Lassy Small corpus. The results are projected back onto the Frisian text and are manually checked and corrected.

**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):**

Researchers often want to enrich texts with linguistic features such as Part-of-Speech tags, lemmas, dependency relations, etc. These often provide useful features for text mining or as preprocessing towards further ends.

**Targeted/Actual users:**

Researchers that study the Frisian language or Frisian in the context of Germanic languages.

**Actual use (quantify!):**

The newly developed tool is expected to be used at least monthly.
