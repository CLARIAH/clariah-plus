# CLARIAH Interest Group on Annotation Infrastructure

Development in the [CLARIAH](https://clariah.nl) project is coordinated through themed [Interest Groups](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG). This repository is intended to organize the work, output and documentation of the CLARIAH Interest Group (IG) on Annotation Infrastructure. Other [CLARIAH Interest Groups](#other-interets-groups) are listed below. 

## Introduction

The enrichment of various types of data with all kinds of annotations is a shared
interest of several WPs, although requirements may differ greatly depending on the
material to be annotated. The further development of a network of distributed
annotation servers in WP2 calls for close collaboration with WP3, WP5 and WP6,
who have defined several annotation-related tasks.

## Aims of the Interest Group

The aims of the IG on Annotation Infrastructure are:

- foster discussion and knowledge sharing regarding annotation infrastructure
- develop and share best practices
- inform development of CLARIAH annotation tools and services

## Scope of the Interest Group

- [inventory of need for manual annotation support in CLARIAH](./docs/annotation-needs.md)
- support of the creation and use of annotations on any media type
- support of manual annotation processes
- support of manual correction of automatic annotation
- [inventory of and recommendations for annotation models, formats and converters](./docs/inventory.md)

Annotation aspects that are outside the scope of this Interest Group (because they are covered by other IGs):

- automatic annotation processes
- crowdsourcing
- ...


## Contributing and Communication

This group is open to anyone interested in annotation in the context of CLARIAH.

If you want to contribute, please the [Contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

We use the following communication channel:

- [gitter](https://gitter.im/CLARIAH/chat)

## Tasks

Annotation infrastructure problems that we try to tackle are:

- Storage and distribution
- Querying
- Interoperability
    - Video Annotation Interoperability ([VAINT](https://github.com/CLARIAH/video-annotation-interoperability)) initiative
- Provenance and context of creation
- Shared libraries of basic annotation components
- Choosing standards
