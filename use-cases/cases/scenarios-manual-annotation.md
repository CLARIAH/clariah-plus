## Description

To develop generic infrastructure for manual annotation scenarios in all CLARIAH research domains and for a range of different annotation scenarios, we need to experiment with such scenarios by implementing them to some extend. On the other hand, full blown web applications are expensive to build and therefore out of scope for this use case.

We already have a good inventory of scholarly annotation scenarios available from previous research in CLARIAH Plus context (Koolen et al.). We propose to implement a number of those scenarios in rudimentary form ('micro-frontends': minimalistic web applications, jupyter notebooks, etc) to learn about the exact community requirements for manual annotation and for the infrastructure that is needed for that.

We do this in conjunction with the use cases "Store, share and search web annotations" and "Annotatable collections". However, this use case does not depend on the other two: web annotations can already be stored and shared in trivial ways (e.g. as files, sent by email). And a number of online collections is already 'annotatable' in the intended way, more specifically collections that implement 'IIIF Presentation'.

### What is the research about?

Find out about exact requirements for annotation infrastructure in CLARIAH Plus.

### What problem is hindering the research?

The need for online manual annotation infrastructure is often raised, in CLARIAH Plus and wider contexts. Still, manual annotation is not yet widely used. Probably the following three reasons play a role:

1. it is not easy enough to generate standard web annotations during scholarly workflows and handle them using standard web protocols.
2. once created, there is no easily accessible and community supported place to store those annotations
3. online collections can not be easily annotated, because they typically do not explicitly and persistently publish the (URIs of the) elements that can be annotated.

We defined use cases to tackle all three of these problems. 

For 1, use case "Micro-frontends for manual scholarly annotations"
For 2, use case "Store, share and search web annotations"
For 3, use case "Annotatable collections"
