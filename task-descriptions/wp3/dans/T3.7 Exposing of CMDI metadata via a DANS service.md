# T3.7 Exposing of CMDI metadata via a DANS service

**ID**: *T3.7*

**Author:** *Jerry de Vries*

**Introduction:**

*This task focuses on the exposing of CMDI metadata via a DANS service. The main goal is to extract stored CMDI metadata, transform metadata to a standardized schema and deliver the transformed metadata back to a research environment or archive, resulting in harvestable CLARIN metadata, interoperable with CLARIN discover services*

**What exists:**

*At DANS-EASY aprox 1000 CLARIN datasets are stored with CMDI metadata as a separate file attached to the dataset.*

**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:**

*DANS is developping an ETL-pipeline to extract, transform and load the CMDI metadata stored at DANS-EASY. Due to the migration of DANS-EASY to Dataverse, the Dataverse metadata schmeme will be extended to accept the transformed CMDI metadata for storing CMDI (meta)data*

**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):**

*CLARIN datasets will become FAIR, hence the visibility of CLARIN datasets at DANS in CLARIN search and discovery services.*

**Targeted/Actual users:**

*Researchers searchihg for CLARIN datasets and researchers who want to archive their datasets*

**Actual use (quantify!):**

*t.b.d.*

**Lead**: *Jerry de Vries - DANS*

**Participants**: *Vyacheslav Tykhonov, Eko Indarto (All DANS)*

**Allocated PMs:** *A total of 15PM for tasks 3.4, 3.7 and 3.8 (All WP3 work DANS is involved in)*

## Deliverables
- T3.7 ECMDIDS3 - Visibility of CLARIN Datasets at DANS in CLARIN search and discovery services

## Milestones

- T3.7 ECMDIDS1 – Data extraction (automated), Data transformation, Transformed data delivery to research
- T3.7 ECMDIDS2 - Harvestable CLARIN Metadata, interoperable with CLARIN discovery services
- T3.7 ECMDIDS4 – Software must be running till end of CLARIAH+ project
