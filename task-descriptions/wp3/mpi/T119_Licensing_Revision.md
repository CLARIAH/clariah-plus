# Licensing Revision

**ID**: T119

**Author:** Paul Trilsbeek

**Introduction:**

Revision of licenses and agreements currently in use at The Language Archive

**What exists:**

Codes of conduct, end user license agreements and deposit agreements currently in use mostly predate a lot of developments in this area, such as the development of Creative Commons licenses.

**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:**

New end user license agreements and possibly deposit agreements need to be chosen or created, by taking developments of the past years into account with respect to licensing of research data, including the work that has been done in CLARIN. 

**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):**

Better and clearer license agreements are beneficial for re-using the data collections and for getting depositors to open up more of their collections for scientific use.

**Targeted/Actual users:**

Anyone interested in using the collections in The Language Archive as well as any depositors of data.

**Actual use (quantify!):**

More than 1300 registered users and an unknown number of anonymous users of The Language Archive, as well as more than 300 depositors of data.

**Lead**: Paul Trilsbeek, MPI

**Allocated PMs:** 3 PM
