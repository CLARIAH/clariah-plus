# Agenda for the first IG-LOD meetup
2020-10-16, 12:00-13:30 hours

In general the agenda is to confirm the aim, scope (key components) and organisation of the IG-LOD.

## Why IG-LOD
In CLARIAH CORE infra-structure and tools were mainly developed on a by workpackage basis. The IG-LOD aims to gather, asses and link (or reconstruct) these parts whilst making sure the WP's needs (requirements) are safe guarded. 

## Key components of IG-LOD
- Production: creation of Linked Data (via scripts, tools, machines);
- Storage: storage itself (formats, speed), access for depositing and retrieving Linked Data;
- Models: design and reuse of data models, ontologies and vocabs (unless handled by IG-Curation);
- Use: browsing and queyring Linked Data, API generation, data stories.

## Organization principles of IG-LOD
- subgroups by key components;
- engineers on top, supported by senior staff;
- subgroup meetings and IG-LOD meetings;
- communication: Slack (quick and dirty), Github (documentation)
