## Technology Readiness Level

The technology axis we define using the “Technology Readiness Level” (TRL), a measure that defines the development
status of a service. See the various levels in the table below. The stages that group the levels correspond to
the vocabulary already used in the CLARIAH-PLUS workplan. We generally aim for at least TRL7.

* **Planning** stage *(pre-alpha)*:
    * **0 - Idea** - Unproven, untested and largely unformulated concept
    * **1 - Initial Research** - Basic (scholarly) needs observed and reported
    * **2 - Concept Formulated** - Initial technology/application has been concept formulated
* **Proof of Concept** stage *(alpha)*:
    * **3 - Proof of Concept** - Initial Proof-of-concept of key functionality . Concept presented for initial feedback from scholarly users. Not yet validated and not suitable for end-users yet.
    * **4 - Validated Proof of Concept** - Validated Proof-of-concept of key functionality. Technology validated in its own experimental setting (e.g. the lab). Not mature enough for end-users yet.
* **Experimental** stage *(beta)*:
    * **5 - Early Prototype** - Technology validated in target setting (e.g. with potential end-users)
    * **6 - Late Prototype** - Technology demonstrated in target setting, end-users adopt it for testing purposes.
    * **7 - Release Candidate** -  Technology ready enough and in initial use by end-users in intended scholarly environments. Further validation in progress.
* **Production** stage (stable):
    * **8 - Complete** - Technology complete and qualified, released for all end-users in scholarly environments.
    * **9 - Proven** - Technology complete and proven in practice by real users.
