# CLARIAH Interest Group on Curation

CLARIAH is organized in Work Packages and Interest Groups (IG's). The main goal of each IG is to research, negotiate, propose, and implement technical choices that become a standard requirement in CLARIAH. This repository is intended to organize the work of the CLARIAH Interest Group (IG) on Curation. Please check out the overall [IG page](https://github.com/clariah/ig/) for more information.

## Aims of the Interest Group

The aims of the IG on Curation are:
- inform development of CLARIAH curation services
- foster discussion and knowledge sharing regarding data curation, modeling and enrichment
- develop and share best practices


## Scope of the Interest Group

- stimulate coordination between the WPs on the use of conversion tools (data converters) 
- support for the development of a CLARIAH library of curation and conversion tools
- support for the creation and maintenance of documentation on data standards and vocabularies
- support for the implementation of the FAIR guiding principles, with specific emphasis on data interoperability and reusability
