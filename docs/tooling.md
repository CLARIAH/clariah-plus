Considerations:

* **Elucidate**: Although the CLARIAH SWA server is intended to capture all needs, the Elucidate server seems to have developed more to a stable and advanced implementation ([https://github.com/dlcs/elucidate-server/blob/master/USAGE.md](https://github.com/dlcs/elucidate-server/blob/master/USAGE.md)). One issue with Elucidate is that its maintenance seems to have stopped (the latest commit to the master branch is from October 2018, for the develop branch it is April 2019). Currently we’re conducting a test to set up the server and submit and retrieve annotations, but there are several code updates required and the API seems to not work as documented. TO DO: check if extensions on WA format can be stored and retrieved. Particularly NestedPIDSelector.
* **Hypothes.is**: Hypothes.is could be used but has its own database. For CLARIAH we could run our own instance, but the Hypothes.is API ([https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/](https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/)) seems less advanced than the Elucidate API ([https://github.com/dlcs/elucidate-server/blob/master/USAGE.md](https://github.com/dlcs/elucidate-server/blob/master/USAGE.md)). 
*   For many use cases ([see above](#use-cases)), the Elucidate server seems to offer the required support.
