## Description

### What is the research about?

How can we make immaterial traces from the past tangible as sustainable and reusable data for urban  communities and stakeholders? The [Stories in Motion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aihuRMvYeU5nrKOLG0D47h2CTQw0i1S2rBREE52mttk/edit) project aims to create a much-needed model for collecting, archiving and (re-)using oral histories.

This use case on ‘[Gerse Vrouwen](https://digitup.nl/gerse-vrouwen/)’ and ‘[Out in Rotterdam](https://digitup.nl/outinrotterdam/)’ will make the oral histories collected accessible as data in the Media Suite. The resulting model (‘Story Cycle Model’) will be developed in co-creative workshops with the project’s collaboration partners and their volunteers throughout June 2021-May 2022.


### What problem is hindering the research?

Many oral history collections remain outside of the scope of CLARIAH and are not reused for research because heritage organisations lack the necessary skills and manpower to store data at DANS, which ensures ingestion in the Media Suite and enables reuse.

1. Consent forms: heritage organisations do not implement forms that fully comply with DANS regulations

2. Metadata : heritage associations do not adhere to standards required by DANS

Following this, ingestion into the CLARIAH Media Suite and research into oral history in CLARIAH is hampered.


### What is needed to do the research?

The model developed in 2019 for CLARIAH-CORE should be tested. Our aim is to develop an updated model with learning materials, metadata templates, a workflow and a tutorial for heritage associations. These should enable them to ingest their collections in large scale research infrastructures through DANS. As a result, more Dutch oral history collections can be re-used for the purpose of academic research and teaching.


#### Data

Datasets Gerse Vrouwen and Out in Rotterdam, collected in between September 2021 - March 2022.


#### Tools

n/a

### What software and services are involved?

DANS is involved in this process. However, newly deposited collections in DANS-EASY are not ingested into the Media Suite automatically. This use case also wants to investigate how the process may be automated, or done manually at regular intervals.

### How to evaluate this?

Throughout the Stories in Motion project, participants and heritage organisations will be asked about the model and their needs for training. At the end of the project, the participating interviewers and organisations will be asked to assess their implementation of the model.
