## Description

### What is the research about?

Citation from M. van Gompel & I. Hendrickx (2018):

> The ICT-Research Platform Netherlands and NWO organise a yearly one-week workshop ‘ICT with Industry’ to stimulate
> collaboration between industry and academia. The industrial partner provides a problem and a team of researchers from
> different backgrounds and universities collaborate to come up with solutions. We participated in the 2019 edition on
> the case study by the Dutch Royal Library who wanted to investigate automatic methods for cataloguing of textual
> cultural heritage objects, in this particular case a large collection of digital dissertations.

### What problem is hindering the research?

None, LaMachine was taken as an out-of-the-box solution.

### What is needed to do the research?

#### Tools

LaMachine was used as the solution to bring the tools to the data. Better integration between host and VM, with regards
to shared data space, was implemented.

### What software and services are involved?

Various "common scientific data-related packages" as made available through LaMachine.

### How to evaluate this?

Citation from M. van Gompel & I. Hendrickx (2018):

> LaMachine offered a convenient platform for a range of different explorations and experiments in the area of NLP and
> text mining. However, for some situations LaMachine, or rather Linux in general, was not a good fit for the audience
> of the workshop: for team members who did not have experience with a non-Windows environment, LaMachine was not a
> suitable or useful tool. The limit of LaMachine was also reached for members who wanted to use desktop text editors
> with a graphical user interface as this is not offered by LaMachine. Moreover, we did not manage to get X-forwarding
> working in the Ubuntu Linux VM and after a few attempts the team gave up on resolving this issue due to time pressure.
> This, also demonstrates that fine-tuning the configuration of certain aspects of LaMachine, but especially beyond
> LaMachine, is beyond the reach of a data scientist without system administration skills. This certainly also applies
> also to the installation as a whole in the SURFsara context, which involved things like the partitioning, formatting
> and mounting of (virtual) drives and setting up user accounts on the shared VM, all of which require some system
> administration skills and are too context-specific to be within the scope of LaMachine. LaMachine was convenient and
> speeded up writing code as the most common scientific data-related packages are already present in LaMachine
