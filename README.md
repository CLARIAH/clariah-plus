# CLARIAH Interest Group on Text

This repository is intended to organize the work, output and documentation of the CLARIAH Interest Group (IG) on Text
Processing.

*(note: in the current stage, all of this should be interpreted as a proposal and open for discussion)*

## Introduction

There is a CLARIAH-wide need for robust text processing technologies that can handle historical as well as contemporary
Dutch texts. Partners like VU, INT and RU have contributed different components in WP3 and WP6.

## Aims of the Interest Group

The aims of the IG on Text are:

- foster discussion and knowledge sharing regarding automatic text processing
- enhance interoperability between various text processing solutions
- develop and share best practices
- inform development of CLARIAH text processing tools and services

## Scope of the Interest Group

Our scope is **automatic** text processing, and roughly encompasses the following fields:

- Natural Language Processing
    - automatic linguistic enrichment for multiple languages and multiple time periods
        - named entity extraction & linking
        - dependency parsing, syntactic parsing, morphological analysis
        - part-of-speech tagging
        - lemmatisation
        - sentiment analysis
        - tokenisation and sentence segmentation
    - text normalisation (including post-OCR/HTR correction)
    - optical character recognition & handwriting recognition
    - machine translation
    - language modelling
- Text Mining
- Text Search & Retrieval (raw text, querying of annotations is covered by the [annotation group](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Annotation))

Though our scope is not limited to Dutch, it is probably fair to say that Dutch, Flemish and Frisian, merit most
attention, as we are a project in the Netherlands.

Aspects that are outside the scope of this Interest Group (because they are covered by other IGs):

- manual text annotation (covered by the [annotation group](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Annotation))
- annotation models and formats (covered by the [annotation group](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Annotation))
- speech recognition (covered by the AV group)

## Communication

We use the following communication channel:

- [slack](clariah-workspace.slack.com) (if you don't have access yet, please contact one of the coordinators)

## Tasks

1. Provide [an inventory](docs/inventory.md) of current text processing tools, services and models in CLARIAH,
   either developed in CLARIAH (WP3 or WP6), or third party projects that are adopted as solutions.
2. Specify what requirements we want text processing solutions to adhere to for CLARIAH, to facilitate interoperability
   between tools/services. Indicate to what extent the existing solutions adhere to these requirements.
