# Data and Metadata Curation

**ID**: T102 + T140

**Author:** Paul Trilsbeek

**Introduction:**

The goal of this task is on the one hand to improve discoverability of existing collections in The Language Archive by improving their metadata, and on the other hand to add new collections to the archive, in particular existing language acquisition corpora that have not been archived anywhere, as well as additional external data collections that are in line with the collection development policy. In addition, two additional features for the archive will be developed, a data citation "button" and a corpus/collection statistics feature.

**What exists:**

The Language Archive is a free comprehensive, living archive of spoken and sign language corpora. Its more than 300 collections contain resources documenting more than 200 different languages, including 64 collections recently added to the prestigious UNESCO Memory of the World register.
The collections contain a wide range of materials, including audio or video recordings as well as transcriptions and further analyses of a part of these recordings. However, the metadata quality varies substantially between and sometimes even within collections, making it difficult for researchers to search for, and identify, relevant materials. For example, author information can often not be derived, either because contributor roles are not defined, or because it is not clear which roles should be mapped to the author role. Crucially, several of the metadata fields that are needed for the CLARIN VLO are often missing.

It is likely that there are numerous data collections from researchers of Dutch language acquisition that are not yet archived in a trusted repository. Without a specialised repository - such as The Language Archive - taking care of the curation and preservation of these collections, they are not accessible to the broader scientific community and are likely to disappear when the researcher retires or passes away.

At the moment there is no information at the individual corpus level about e.g. how many hours of audio/video a corpus contains, how many hours have been transcribed, how many words have been transcribed/translated/glossed etc.

Finding the correct way to cite a resource in the archive is currently not straightforward, the user needs to look for different bits of information in the metadata records.

TLA frequently receives requests for hosting data collections from external researchers. Part of this task will be to support a number of these requests, in addition to the requests we are normally able to accommodate.

**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:**

Metadata curation is needed in order to improve the discoverability of the materials and to enable better citation of archived materials in publications. The curation task will involve the following steps:
• identifying which metadata need to be improved
• assessing whether the missing information can be reliably added by the archive staff themselves
• if that is not the case, contacting depositors to obtain missing information
• adding missing information to CMDI metadata files, automatically if possible, manually if
needed.

Researchers of Dutch language acquisition who might have unarchived data collections will be contacted, with the intention to curate and archive several such collections.

A script/tool will be developed that is able to extract relevant corpus statistics from the annotated multimedia corpora in the archive. For such tool, the relevant annotation tiers/tier types need to be manually identified per corpus. The statistics will be presented on a landing page for each corpus.

A data citation function that allows users to generate a citation with the click of a button is a further enhancement that will be created.

The archive will also curate and archive additional third-party data collections that are in line with its collection development policy.

**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):**

*(Why is this task important for CLARIAH? What does it contribute?)*

**Targeted/Actual users:**

Anyone interested in using the collections in The Language Archive as well as any depositors of data.

**Actual use (quantify!):**

More than 1300 registered users and an unknown number of anonymous users of The Language Archive, as well as more than 300 depositors of data.
