# IG-AVProcessing
This repository is intended to organize the work, output and documentation of the CLARIAH Interest Group (IG) on Audiovisual Processing infrastructure

## Aims of the Interest Group

The aims of the IG on Audiovisual Processing Infrastructure are:

- foster discussion and knowledge sharing regarding infrastructure for AV processing such as automatic speech recognition or computer vision
- develop and share best practices
- inform development of CLARIAH annotation tools and services

## Scope of the Interest Group

- support for the scholarly use of tools for automatic annalysis of audiovisual media
- support for the implementation of AV analysis services/pipelines in the CLARIAH infrastructure
- support for the maintenance, updates and upgrades of tools for automatic annalysis of audiovisual media
- primary focus tools: segmentation, text-audio alignment, speech/speaker recognition, computer vision.

Aspects of audiovisual processing that are outside the scope of this Interest Group (because they are covered by other IGs):

- annotation processes and/or correction of automatic annotation
- crowdsourcing
- ...


## Communication

We use the following communication channel:
- gitter?
- slack

## Tasks

AV processing infrastructure problems that we try to tackle are:

- pipelines for robust and efficient large scale AV processing
- services related to AV processing
- auxiliary tools needed
