# CLARIAH Use Cases: Contribution Guidelines

1. Each use case is described by a Markdown file in the ``cases/`` directory, one file per use-case.
    - Choose a simple descriptibe filename, avoid spaces, and mind that filenames are case-sensitive.
    - All documents should be plain text following [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax and always use the UTF-8 character encoding. Use the ``.md`` extension.
    - We recommend you use [this template](TEMPLATE.md) as a basis for your use case document, but feel free to add things or deviate from it if it's not sufficient for your needs. Do make sure to check out the template for an idea of the information we request.
    - You can use any text editor you like, or edit online through the interface offered by Github.
2. Link to your document from the ``README.md``, where you have room for a simple title and optionally a short
   description. You can just copy and adapt one of the existing entries.
3. Submit your contributions as a [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request). This automatically opens up a thread for **discussion and peer review** of your contributions and will notify all group members. A coordinator can finally **approve and merge** your contributions.
    - Trivial contributions (spelling corrections etc) can be contributed directly if you have push access to the
      repository.
