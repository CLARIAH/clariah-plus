# Tool Discovery

* **User story**: *As a scholar, I* am looking for tools and want to browse through and search in a registry of available tools *in order to* select the tools I need to further my research.
* **Implementations**: Ineo, CLARIN switchboard, LaMachine portal, CLAPOP
* **Proposed discussion points**:
    * Vocabularies for software/service metadata (codemeta/cmdi)
    * Automatic harvesting of software/service metadata
    * Registry and backend API for collected software/service metadata
    * Possible collaboration with the CLARIN switchboard
    * Ineo only as a thin frontend layer
