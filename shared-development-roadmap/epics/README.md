# CLARIAH Shared Development Roadmap: Shared core Epics

**Shared core epics** describe epics providing core shared functionality
for the infrastructure as a whole. The services that implement these serve
scholarly use cases and are generic or pervasive (i.e. the needs or
requirements that need to be fulfilled are often not directly formulated and
recognized as such by scholars). These provide an important pillar for the
shared infrastructure. Their development is typically a cross-WP effort.
