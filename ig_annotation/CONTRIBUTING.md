CLARIAH Interest Group Contribution Guidelines
================================================

1. All relevant documents and other group output is gathered in this **central** and **public git repository** in the [CLARIAH](https://github.com/CLARIAH) github group.
    - This ensures everything can be found in one place and is under proper version control and that everybody
      is free to use the tools they prefer to edit the contents.
    - This provides transparency and accountability.
    - If there are relevant external resources then they should be **linked** from one or more documents this repository, a URL in relevant document will do.
    - If the output of the group consists of custom-made software then that will be hosted in its
      own separate repository and will be linked to from one of more documents in this repository.
    - Keep documents in **plain text** as much as possible, or more specifically: use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax and always use the UTF-8 character encoding. Prevent proprietary closed formats as much as possible.
2. Group discussion takes place primarily through the **issue tracker** associated with this repository.
    - Discussion is **public** and **open** to group members and non-group members alike (including partners outside of CLARIAH).
    - All issues/tickets should ideally have a well-defined and limited scope; make multiple issues if you want to address multiple points.
    - People who prefer to use their e-mail client can simply reply to the issue notifications received by mail (take
        not of the next point)
3. Group members should make sure to **watch** this repository (click the watch button) to receive notifications on important activity.
4. Group membership is **open** to anybody with an interest in what we are doing and with some relationship to CLARIAH.
5. Please submit significant contributions as [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request). This automatically opens up a thread for **discussion and peer review** of your contributions and will notify all group members. The group coordinator can finally **approve and merge** your contributions.
    - This may be overkill for small edits, in which case direct push access is a more adequate solution.
6. There is a [text-based chat channel on Gitter.im](https://gitter.im/CLARIAH/home) where group members (of all interest groups) can gather and communicate in a more direct and informal manner. Everybody is welcome!
