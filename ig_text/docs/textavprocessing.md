# Text/Multimedia Processing & Analysis

## CLARIAH Services (1)

1. **Natural Language Processing**
    * **User story** *As a scholar,* I want to automatically enrich my texts with linguistic annotation *in order to* facilitate further processing/analysis/visualisation steps for my research.
    * Covers a wide variety of NLP tasks & tools (Frog, Alpino, ucto, UDpipe-frysk)
    * Covers multiple languages (focus often on dutch), also consideration for historical language
    * **Proposed discussion points:**
        * Investing in state-of-the-art techniques (e.g. transformers)
        * Standardize web APIs for NLP tools?

## CLARIAH Services (2)

1. Natural Language Processing
    1. **Spelling correction/normalisation**
        * OCR/HTR post-correction
        * **User story**: As a scholar, I want to correct or normalize text in order to make it more suitable (less errors/noise) for further-processing, whatever that may be; e.g. indexing for search, NLP processing, etc..
        * **Proposed discussion points:** PICCL maintenance issues
    2. **NLP Suites**
        * **Proposed discussion points:**
        * Suites vs individual components
        * Concerns of modularity, reusability and maintainability
    3. **Grapheme to Phoneme conversion**
2. (Annotated) Text Conversion
    * **User story**: As a scholar, I want to convert my (annotated) text document from one format to another *in order to* use my data with a tool that requires a different format, or because I want to store and archive it in a different format

4. Speech Recognition
    * **User story**: As a scholar, I want to create a speech transcripts for an audiofile so that I have a textual representation of it for browsing/close reading
    * **Proposed discussion points:**
    * Suitability of DANE in a wider context (text)?
    * User-story 2 (search)
    * Most dane worker links give a 404

5. Computer vision
    * **User story**: As a scholar, I want to use computer vision to explore data collections based on image features such as objects that are visible, shots or colours.

6. Linguistic Diagnostics Database
    * **User story**: As a scholar, I want to quickly find all arguments from the literature for or against a linguistic property of a word or construction
    * **Proposed discussion points:**
        * Interesting but very specific use case; less relevant from a cross-WP and overall infrastructure perspective
        * Suitability of PICCL for this is questionable due to sustainability issues
        * PDF processing components

7. Glossing service
    * **User story**: As a scholar, I want to use dutch examples in an English article and the gloss and translation should be added automatically
    * **Proposed discussion points:**
        * Move to NLP?
        * Suitability of PICCL for this is questionable due to sustainability issues
