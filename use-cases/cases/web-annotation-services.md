## Description

Web annotations are becoming more and more common as part of scholarly workflows. Clearly, once these annotations are created by researchers they need services to store, manage, share and search those annotations, along with the annotations of others. These services have to comply to the W3C Web Annotation Model and Protocol.

Previous work on Web Annotation servers has been done both within the CLARIAH Plus community (HuC, B&G) and outside, e.g. the eLucidate annotation server (https://github.com/dlcs/elucidate-server).

This use case builds on this earlier work. The aim is to select, test and possibly extend annotation server infrastructure that can be used by individual researchers as well as by collection providers and collection managers in the CLARIAH Plus community. 

### What is the research about?

(Manual) annotation is a very generic scholarly task that is performed as part of many types of research. At the same time, annotations are an important data type by itself, that any researcher could use as 'glue' between different data objects in CLARIAH Plus and other collections without active participation of the providers of those collections.

In this use case we intend to select, apply and test annotation server infrastructure and test it on a selected set of scholarly annotation scenarios (see the use case: 'Micro-frontends for manual scholarly annotation scenarios').

### What problem is hindering the research?

The need for online manual annotation infrastructure is often raised, in CLARIAH Plus and wider contexts. Still, manual annotation is not yet widely used. Probably the following three reasons play a role:

1. it is not easy enough to generate standard web annotations during scholarly workflows and handle them using standard web protocols.
2. once created, there is no easily accessible and community supported place to store those annotations
3. online collections can not be easily annotated, because they typically do not explicitly and persistently publish the (URIs of the) elements that can be annotated.

We defined use cases to tackle all three of these problems. 

For 1, use case "Micro-frontends for manual scholarly annotations"
For 2, use case "Store, share and search web annotations"
For 3, use case "Annotatable collections"

### What software and services are involved?

- existing prototypes by HuC and B&G (Marijn Koolen et al)
- eLucidate web annotation server
