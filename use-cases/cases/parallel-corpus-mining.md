## Description

Progress in studying verbal tense and aspect semantics can be made by applying quantitative corpus methods in the field of semantic micro-typology, in particular by exploiting the possibilities of translation corpora. 

### What is the research about?

Tense-aspect categories found across languages.

### What problem is hindering the research?

Absence of a flexible, open source and user-friendly environment to explore the corpus data.

### What is needed to do the research?

We propose extensions to blacklab/blacklab-server/autosearch 

* to enable parallel concordancing
* extraction of relevant statistics
* upload of parallel data created by researchers into autosearch
* exploitation of existing parallel corpora

#### Data

Parallel UD-enriched corpora (tagging, lemmatization, dependency syntax)

* created by researchers
* existing corpora (OPUS, etc)

#### Tools

* extended version of blacklab/autosearch
* Visualization and analysis tools developed by the Time in Translation group

### What software and services are involved?


### How to evaluate this?

* Is the researched satisfied?
