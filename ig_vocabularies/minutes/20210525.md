[In progress](https://github.com/CLARIAH/usecases/blob/master/README.md#in-progress)
- [Computer vision annotations 'n' enrichments of audiovisual data](https://github.com/CLARIAH/usecases/blob/master/cases/dane-av-enrichments.md)
    “standard (textual) metadata (i.e., labels and confidences produced by a classification algorithm)” = __schema__
- [Curation of transcribed historical newspaper corpus (Wp6 Use case 2)](https://github.com/CLARIAH/usecases/blob/master/cases/curation-historical-newspapers.md)
    “Data have been transcribed and uploaded in relational database, but metadata and segmentation require extensive curation” = __schema__
- [DANS CMDI use case for CLARIAH WP3](https://github.com/CLARIAH/usecases/blob/master/cases/dans-cmdi.md)
    “Another important problem – the use of FAIR controlled vocabularies for existing CMDI records. DANS is going to extend CMDI processing pipeline with some prediction mechanism making recommendations about possible controlled vocabularies and ontologies that could be used by data managers to improve the quality of CMDI metadata records.” = __vocabs__
- [Historical research on media-events across heterogenous broadcast datasets with linked and missing data](https://github.com/CLARIAH/usecases/blob/master/cases/historical_research_on_media-events_across_heterogenous_broadcast_data.md)
    “The different datasets are not yet linked. The datasets need to be linked by programme title.” ~ __could be an instance vocab aka authority file/list__
- [Linkage of Dutch Civil Records](https://github.com/CLARIAH/usecases/blob/master/cases/civil-records-linkage.md)
    “detected links contains detailed provenance metadata”  = __schema__
- [Providing Language and Speech webservices at CLST (Radboud University, Nijmegen)](https://github.com/CLARIAH/usecases/blob/master/cases/clst-webservices.md)
    “We use [codemeta](https://codemeta.github.io) to record software metadata for all tools included in LaMachine.” = __schema__
