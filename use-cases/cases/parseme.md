## Description


### What is the research about?

PARSEME (PARSing and Multi-word Expressions), is an interdisciplinary scientific network devoted to the role of
multi-word expressions (MWEs) in parsing.

As part of this project, multi-word expressions were annotated on corpora for a wide variety of languages. They
organized several shared task iterations.

### What is needed to do the research?

#### Tools

An annotation environment was needed capable of annotating verbal multi-word expressions for a wide variety of language
(including those with right-to-left scripts). The PARSEME project opted for FLAT. The tool was improved significantly
for the PARSEME project, most notably the [v0.6 release](https://github.com/proycon/flat/releases/tag/v0.6.0). This
release featured more user/permission management functons, the implementation of an automatic conversion step from their
TSV format to FoLiA, and many fixes.

### What software and services are involved?

* FLAT
* FoLiA
