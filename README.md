# CLARIAH-PLUS Project

This is the project planning repository for the [CLARIAH-PLUS
project](https://clariah.nl).  It groups all technical documents and
discussions pertaining to CLARIAH-PLUS in a central place and should facilitate
findability, transparency and project planning, for the project as a whole.

This repository will hold important deliverables such as specifications and technical
requirements we agree upon for the project as a whole.

The issue tracker associated with this github repository is the main place to
hold tickets regarding CLARIAH-PLUS project planning. On top of this we use
GitHub Projects to organize tickets in various kanban boards to guide our
shared development process.

## Motivation

We came from a situation of various separate repositories, but this led to too
much fragmentation, and activity on the individual repositories was often
minimal and boundaries between for instance instance groups could be vague.  We
hope that consolidating our combined efforts in a single repository leads to
increased visibility and participation and collaboration amongst each-other.

Note that this repository does not contain any software projects, those are
always in separate repositories.

## Additional Resources

Sometimes we have additional resources that are not in this git repository
(such as documents on Google Docs or elsewhere), they should be linked from
this repository in all cases except for privacy/security-sensitive documents. A
simple link from a README.md in an appropriate place in this repository
suffices.
