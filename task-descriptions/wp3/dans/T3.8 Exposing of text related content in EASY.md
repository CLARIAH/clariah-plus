# T3.8 Exposing of text related content in EASY


**ID**: *T3.8*

**Author:** *Jerry de Vries*

**Introduction:**

*This task focuses on the proof of concept of the exposing of text related content in EASY as a result of the T3.4 and T3.7 whereby orphaned (CLARIN) datasets have made FAIR and thus visible and interoperable with CLARIN discovery services*

**What exists:**

*A DANS Datastation with archived CLARIN datasets, described by CMDI metadata*

**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:**

*As an result of Tasks 3.4 and 3.7 CLARIN/orphaned datasets are archived at the DANS Datastation. Experiences of the CMDI ETL-pipeline will be described in a conference paper; extended abstract is delivered to the CLARIN annual conference of 2021*

**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):**

*Promote the work done in these tasks and give visibility to the CMDI work and the archived CLARIN datasets*

**Targeted/Actual users:**

*Researchers searching for CLARIN datasets and researchers who want to archive their datasets*

**Actual use (quantify!):**

*At least 1 conference paper written, aiming for more*

**Lead**: *Jerry de Vries - DANS*

**Participants**: *Vyacheslav Tykhonov, Eko Indarto, Femmy Admiraal (All DANS)*

**Allocated PMs:** *A total of 15PM for tasks 3.4, 3.7 and 3.8 (All WP3 work DANS is involved in*
