# IG
CLARIAH Interest Groups

The CLARIAH Interest Groups (IGs) have been established to support the CLARIAH development teams in making **well-informed decisions** on topics within the [CLARIAH Shared Development Roadmap](https://github.com/CLARIAH/clariah-plus/tree/main/shared-development-roadmap) (SDR), such as standards, best-practices, alignment with institutions and external initiatives, software solutions, and so on. The IGs consist of both domain experts and engineers that share a common ... well ... interest! We set out with a number of Interest Groups based on an inventory of topics such as Preservation, Annotation, Linked Data or Audiovisual Processing, but we noticed that sometimes there was a need for alternative Interest (sub) Groups, and some IG's just ceased to exist. As we imagine that IGs will function only if linked to (a) specific demand(s) from either development or stakeholders, we take a flexible stand that some IGs may have a long lifespan whereas others may only exist for certain time (or can be "sleeping"). 

Note that there is **no development** taking place within the IGs. The main idea is that questions that arise within the SDR projects are redirected to the IGs that will then discuss the topic and bring an advice to the development team of a certain SDR project. If an advice has a critical component (e.g., a choice has to be made on a broader technical level or stakerholder level), CLARIAH has a [Technical Advisory Panel](https://github.com/CLARIAH/clariah-plus/tree/main/technical-committee) to discuss such an advice, with the option to forward a decision to the CLARIAH Board.

Starting with the SDR development work in Q1 2022, we defined the following IGs as being crucial for now:

<!-- In the first 4 years of CLARIAH ('CORE') researchers and engineers were united in Workpackages to garantuee perfect interaction among them, except for one work package. That particular work package was the connection between the engineers from all other WP's and tasked with the design of the overall infra-structure.-->

<!-- It showed that there is a demand for much interaction between the engineers and on a more granular level. Therefore, in the current tranch of CLARIAH ('PLUS'), we foster the cooperation of engineers and harmonization of the infrastructure through Interest Groups. --> 

<!-- This ['live' query](https://github.com/CLARIAH?q=ig&type=&language=) will always be more up to date. -->

The interest groups are:
- [Curation](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Curation)
- Devops
- Linked Open Data (split into subgroups:)
    - [Modeling and Vocabulary Alignment](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Vocabularies)
    - [Publication and Use, Findability](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-LOD-Findability)
    - [Sustainability & Storage](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Sustainability)

<!-- - [Text processing](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Text)-->
<!-- - UI/UX-->
<!-- - [Workflows](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Workflows)-->
<!-- - Preservation-->
<!-- - Security & Monitoring -->
<!-- - [Annotation](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-Annotation) -->
<!-- - [Audiovisual processing](https://github.com/CLARIAH/IG-AVProcessing)-->
