## Stakeholder Readiness Level

We use the “Stakeholder Readiness Level” (SRL), a measure that defines the user
readiness of a new service to be used by scholars. This measure can be used for
example to prioritize development using criteria such as:

* **Value:** the added value of the service for scholars (1-10) EST=10
* **Support/Commitment:** the enthusiasm in the community to adopt the service (1-10)
* **Cost:** costs for development but also cost involved for using (1-10)
* **Adaptability:** the level of adaptability in existing work processes (1-10)
* **Risks:** an assessment of the risks and their manageability that are involved in using the service (1-10)
