## Description

A variety of scholarly research questions require what is sometimes called "semantic access": being able to track down which items (AV documents) in a collection are "about" a certain topic or mention specific keywords related to the topic. Ideally, also where in the document exactly these keywords are mentioned or topics discussed. Evidently this is especially the case with longer documents and large to very large AV data sets, such as the NISV archive, Oral History collections at DANS, or spoken word collections at Meertens Institute.

For audiovisual data (radio & television broadcasts, oral history collections, spoken word collections), descriptive metadata that can be used for this type of fine-grained searching is typically sparse. Certain collections come with data that could be used  such as subtitles for the hearing impaired (recent television broadcasts) or manually generated speech transcripts (e.g., in context of Oral History). However, these data are either not used in the search system or are lacking time-codes to link directly to the AV document it relates to.

In short and in general, researchers require improved search functionality on a semantic level of AV documents that is time-based or segment based. Following the model of scholarly primitives of Unsworth 2000, this use case is typically part of the "Discovering", "Annotating" and "Comparing" primitives of scholarly practice. Based on Palmer et al. 2009, this relates to the activities of "Searching" and "Collecting". Note that also for the linking (cross-media) of topics within documents, this type of semantic access is required.


### What is the research about?

The two initial use cases addressed in this context in CLARIAH are Media Studies and Oral History. However, the described use scenario is relevant to many other research domains, from psychology to linguistics.

### What problem is hindering the research?

To facilitate fine-grained access (e.g., time-based searching) to audiovisual data, speech in AV data can be decoded into text by applying automatic speech recognition technology (speech-to-text). However, commercial or available open-source systems for automatic speech recognition have serious limitations for use in scholarly research: they are expensive, lack quality that is required for the heterogeneous (Dutch) data scholars (in general) are interested in, are hard to use without technical know-how, cannot be easily applied to large collections, etc.

When speech transcripts such as subtitles or manually generated transcripts are available, the problem is that these are often not aligned to the timings of speech in the AV documents (e.g., where a specific word is mentioned).

#### Tools

For AV collections in the CLARIAH infrastructure, scholars need time-coded transcriptions of the spoken word that are indexed to enable collection search, within-document search and linking topics between multimedia collections.

This can be facilitated with three tools:
1. **automatic speech recognition (ASR)**
  - in bulk processing mode to handle large volumes of (archive) data
  - in request mode for handling (or re-doing) parts of a large collection
  - in private mode for handling personal data collections (e.g., locally stored interview collections)
2. **text-to-speech alignment**
  - in bulk processing mode to align subtitles in large AV collections
  - in private mode to convert documents created in personal transcription tools (e.g., MS Word) to a time-coded interoperable format that can be indexed.
3. **segment search**

### What software and services are involved?

Currently we are working with the Kaldi_NL open-source speech recognition toolkit and alignment tool maintained by [Stichting Openspraaktechnologie](https://openspraaktechnologie.org/). See also this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/opensource-spraakherkenning-nl). A special version of this recognizer tuned towards Oral History collections within CLARIAH is also offered via [Lama webservies at CLST](https://webservices.cls.ru.nl/oralhistory).

Kaldi_NL is implemented in the [DANE](https://github.com/CLARIAH/DANE) workflow tool at NISV facilitating ASR transcription for the collections in the [CLARIAH Media Suite](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/).

#### Data

For the ASR and alignment tools to work, they need access to the source data (audio or video). If needed, audio can be stripped from the video (as the video channel is not used). Raw audio data should typically in 16kHz/16bits format.

Note that access to the source data can be problematic due to copyright or privacy constraints.

### How to evaluate this?
