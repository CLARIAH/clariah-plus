# Topic: Curate existing language learners databases & pathological databases and make them searchable

**ID:** T004, T005


**Author:** Henk van den Heuvel, Maarten van Gompel


**What exists:**
* Basilex and Basiscript corpora, both delivered in FoLiA
* Jasmin-CGN and Diglin databases
* FoLiA

**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:**

* Basilex corpus currently has FoLiA validation errors that need to be fixed (0.3PM)
* Jasmin-CGN and Diglin must be must be:
    * curated into FoLiA format
    * Metadated
    * Student annotations  : 7500 EUR (300 uur)
    * Inclusion into search interface (e.g. OpenSoNaR+)
* Datacuratie management over 5 years
    * The exact list of corpora/datasets to be curated must be determined with CLARIAH's EB.

**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):**

Access and preservation, FoLiA is a de-facto CLARIN standard.


**Targeted/Actual users:** Linguists, Language Learners


**Actual use (quantify!):** Many

**Social Impact (concrete examples):** curated resources can be easily be integrated in other FoLiA-based resources

**Lead:** Henk van den Heuvel

**Proposed PM estimation (try to justify):** 9.2 PM  + students assistants 7500 euro in total

**Allocated PMs**: 10 PM

**Proposed participants + PMs:**

* Henk van den Heuvel  datacuratie over 4 years  0,1 fte 4 * 12 * 0.1 = 4.8 PM
* Maarten van Gompel,  Curation of corpora into FoLiA: 2  PM
* Programmer for inclusion into Search interface: 3.2 PM

## Deliverables

1. Curated Basilex corpus (in FoLiA)
2. Curated Jasmin-CGN (in FoLiA)
3. Curated Diglin (in FoLiA)
4. Search interface (e.g. OpenSoNaR+) with all corpora
