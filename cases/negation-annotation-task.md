## Description

### What is the research about?

Citation from research plan by Tom Sweers:

> The aim of this research is to investigate negation detection models in Dutch
> dialogue. A small corpus will be annotated, multiple models will be experimented with.

> The context of this research is the BLISS Project (Waterschoot et al. 2020).
> BLISS is a dialogue agent that tries to find what makes the people it converses
> with happy and healthy.

### What is needed to do the research?

#### Data

Citation from research plan by Tom Sweers:

> Since there is no Dutch negation corpus outside of the medical domain, an existing corpus needs to be annotated for negation.

#### Tools

An annotation environment is needed to annotate negation cues and scope. FLAT was chosen as a solution. This use case is
covered by the FLAT and FoLiA support tasks.

Relevant issues that arose and were handled in the scope of this use case:

* [FLAT: Implement support for modality annotation](https://github.com/proycon/flat/issues/161)
* [FoLiA: Representing negation annotation with cues and scopes in FoLiA](https://github.com/proycon/folia/issues/86)

### What software and services are involved?

* FLAT
* FoLiA

### How to evaluate this?
