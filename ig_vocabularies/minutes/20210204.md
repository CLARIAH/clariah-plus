### Sjors:
 - Finding recommended vocabularies:
   - From the LOD subgroup ‘Publication and use, findability’:
     1. [Clariah Github list](https://github.com/CLARIAH/awesome-humanities-ontologies)
     2. [Archivo](https://archivo.dbpedia.org/) (via dbpedia)
     3. ~~[Dbpedia lookup](https://lookup.dbpedia.org/)~~
     4. [Bartoc](http://bartoc.org/)
     5. [Prefix lookup](http://prefix.cc/) 
     6. YALC (Yet Another LOD Cloud) https://github.com/TriplyDB/YALC . Please upload to YALC!
     7. https://old.datahub.io/ or another ckan-based solution?
   - Zazuko’s Prefix Server for finding properties in ontologies: https://prefix.zazuko.com/
 - Procedures for proposing changes to terms:
   - RKDartists: Artists4All - https://pro.europeana.eu/post/crowdsourcing-with-artists4all-at-the-rkd-netherlands-institute-for-art-history
   - NIOD: WW2 Thesaurus - https://www.niod.nl/nl/wo2-thesaurus (“Wie onderhoudt de WO2-thesaurus?”)

## Agenda
### Do we want to be an IG on our own?
1. We first want to develop use cases to see what specific work the IGs will undertake before considering merging/splitting
2. We will ask Richard about a more general meeting (what we had expected to have on the Tech Day)
### [OntoPortal](https://ontoportal.org/ )
### Clariah LDWizard (prototype)
1. Converts csv to LD
2. Recommends terms from vocabularies for column headers
3. Uses Triply, will later be hosted as open source software/service
4. Question: could it be used for alignments? Answer: Not yet, interesting idea
### [Alida](https://lvanwissen.github.io/ga-datasets/) (Amsterdam Linked Data Cloud (Time Machine), Golden Agents fork
### Aim of IG with recommendations - list, LOV,...? 
1. Preference of Clariah for vocabularies certain areas (e.g. Person) and why
2. Vocabularies (and relations) we should not use (and why)
3. What we use (subset of the recommendations)
4. Official stamp of ‘clariah approved’ or leave it more open - describe experiences, advantages/disadvantages and what is used in Clariah (and beyond) so that people choose themselves? Official stamp is very hard to achieve and can also go out of date quickly
5. How do we maintain the list?
6. Proposal: build a prototype of a viewer (on top of YALC? OntoPortal? CKAN?)
### Leon: We can get access to the PoolParty for the RCE thesauri
### [Ontome](https://ontome.dataforhistory.org/)
