# T3.4 Archiving of “orphan data sets”

**ID**: *T3.4*

**Author:** *Jerry de Vries*

**Introduction:**

*This task focuses on the archiving of orphan data sets (e.g. datasets from the CLARIN community which are not archived in CLARIN centers for the long-term. Knowledge to fulfill this task will be used to archive new research/data in the future.* 

**What exists:**

*A list of data sets scattered around different places, including DANS-EASY, not properly described and thus hard to find and download.*

**What must be adapted / extended / created anew:**

*The archiving of orphan data should include storage of CMDI-metadata for these data to make the data FAIR. This relates to the work done by DANS in T3.7*

**Why important for CLARIAH (scientific impact):**

*CLARIN datasets will become FAIR, which support the reuse of these data sets.*

**Targeted/Actual users:**

*Researchers searching for CLARIN datasets*

**Actual use (quantify!):**

*t.b.d.*

**Lead**: *Jerry de Vries - DANS*

**Participants**: *Vyacheslav Tykhonov, Eko Indarto (All DANS)*

**Allocated PMs:** *A total of 15PM for tasks 3.4, 3.7 and 3.8 (All WP3 work DANS is involved in*
